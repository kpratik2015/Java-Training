## Strings

Heap is where all the objects are kept

The strings that are hardcoded in code are put into string pool

Dynamic string i.e. string content produced at runtime will be on heap or one with new

_intern() will force a string to string pool. Forcibly keeping objects in string pool is costly because they're not easily available for garbage collection_

Strings are constant (immutable). They cannot change. That is, on doing uppercase function on a string, a new object is created in memory. 
_However, String buffers are mutable_
